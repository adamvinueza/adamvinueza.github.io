The world can seem as if everyone else, or at least everyone else who matters to
you, has all the luck. These people got the violin lessons, the private tutors;
they had the talent or the grace; they got into Stanford or Harvard; they got
the internships at Google or Apple or Amazon.

Meanwhile, you dropped out of college because, well, you don't really know, but
you didn't quite know why you were there and you didn't have tons of money, or
your family didn't; or you got in over your head and were too freaked out to
tell anyone; or your little brother got sick and you had to find a job so he
could get healthcare and not die; or you got married and had a kid--it seemed
like a good idea at the time--but Mr. Husband is now Mr. Ex-Husband and is gone
and you have a child or two and sometimes it's so fucking hard your head could
explode but also you've discovered that now you love something more than you
ever believed possible, so that's your life now.

So that's your life now. But, you're reading this blog. You're wanting to become
an engineer; maybe you went to a boot camp, or miraculously scraped up enough
money to spend a semester or two at a university, and fell in love with
programming. _There is so much to learn_, and it's not so much that you don't
know where to begin as you don't know where you're going to find the time and
the emotional energy to spend on focusing on something like that. You have a
full-time job doing something else--maybe it's taking care of your kids, or
maybe you're doing that, too, on top of your job--so WHEN THE FUCK AM I GOING TO
FIND TIME TO DO THIS?

The most important thing, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, is this: keep moving
forward. Continue to study, continue to improve yourself, even if it's just one
small thing every week. Keep at the work.

Sometimes you will feel bone-deep awful, sometimes you will feel overwhelmed,
sometimes you will feel like the goals aren't worth the effort you put in,
sometimes you will feel utterly defeated. All of this is normal; everyone--even
the blessed Stanford grads in their shiny Google offices, smiling from their
Instagram posts--feel this way sometimes. And everyone feels like this sometimes
for reasons that _seem perfectly valid to them_.
