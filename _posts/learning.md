>"I realized that what’s important is hiring people who are confident in their
ability to go find information and to learn. I don’t care if they actually know
things or not when I hire them. The best programmers don’t know everything, but
they know how to quickly pick up whatever it is they need to do. You can become
good at picking things up fast, mostly by doing it a lot. Of course, it’s not
something you can put on a résumé. The usual interview process is miserable at
detecting it. But when I see it in someone, I know it instantly and I want to
hire them."
