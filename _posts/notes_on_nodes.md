Lots of data structures make use of a simple data structure known as a _node_.
A node has two properties: a _value_--some kind of manipulatable content--and
one or more pointers to other nodes:

Nodes can usually be found inside the following fundamental data structures:
- lists
- stacks
- queues
- trees
- hash tables
- graphs

That is to say, nodes are literally _everywhere_ in computing, from mobile apps
to databases to operating systems. This post is about _why_ they are so
ubiquitous: what is it about nodes that makes them so useful?
