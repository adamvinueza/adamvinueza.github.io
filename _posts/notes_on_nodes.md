Lots of data structures make use of a simple data structure known as a _node_.
A node has two properties: a _value_--some kind of manipulatable content--and
one or more pointers to other nodes. As simple as nodes are, they contain
immense conceptual power.

Nodes can usually be found inside the following ubiquitous data structures:
- lists
- stacks
- queues
- trees
- hash tables
- graphs
That is to say, nodes are literally _everywhere_ in computing, from mobile apps
to databases to operating systems.

Why are nodes such a powerful data structure?
