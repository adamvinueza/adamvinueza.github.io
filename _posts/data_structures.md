Linus Torvalds, originator of the humbly named Linux operating system, has [this
to say](https://lwn.net/Articles/193245/) about the importance of data
structures:
>I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good
>one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important.
What does this mean, and how can it guide us towards being better programmers?
