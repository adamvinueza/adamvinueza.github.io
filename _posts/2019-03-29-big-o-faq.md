In my last post, I discussed the reasons for studying big-O algorithm analysis.
This post answers a few questions I often get about big-O.

## Frequently asked questions about big-O

### What does the 'O' stand for?

The 'O' stands for the _order_ of the function. In mathematics, an _ordering_ is
just a sequence in a particular order. Magnitudes of 10, for example, have an
order, based on the exponent to which 10 is raised: the higher the number, the
higher the _order of magnitude_.

The most commonly encountered categories of orders of functions are as follows,
in increasing order of complexity:

- *Constant*: O(1) indicates that there is a constant number of operations
  regardless of the input to the function.
- *Logarithmic*: O(log n) indicates that the number of operations increases as a
  base-2 logarithmic function of the input to the function: the number of
  operations is no larger than log (base 2) of n.
- *Linear*: O(n) indicates that the number of operations increases as a linear
  function of the input to the function. We call it "linear" because if you
  graph the number of operations against the input, the graph is a straight
  line.
- *Quadratic*: O(n<sup>k</sup>) indicates that the number of operations as a
  quadratic function of the input to the function: the value k is a constant,
  but just isn't made specific here--it could be 2, or 4, or 758. Different
  values of k present different orders within this category.
- *Exponential*: O(k<sup>n</sup>) indicates that the number of operations
  increases as an exponential function of the input to the function. The higher
  the value of k, the higher the order within this category.

There are of course orders in between: for example, O(n log n) is between Linear
and Quadratic.

### How hard is the mathematics of determining an algorithm's complexity?

For most of the algorithms you'll encounter, the mathematics required goes no
farther than high-school algebra, but the complexity of the mathematics in
general depends on the algorithm. That said, the overwhelming majority of the
algorithms you're likely to encounter require no more than elementary calculus
to accurately determine their complexity.

### When an algorithm's complexity is, say, O(n), what does 'n' stand for?

The precise meaning of 'n' in O(n) depends on the algorithm itself. If you say
that an algorithm's complexity is O(n), it's your responsibility to specify what
'n' means. We talk broadly about "input", but the input might not be explicit in
the function's signature. For example, consider this Python function:
```python
def print_squared(numeric_string):
    n = int(numeric_string)
    sq = n*n
    for i in range(sq):
        print(i)
```
The `print_squared` function has a complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), even though
the input to the function, strictly speaking, is a single string.  Here, the
function's complexity depends on the size of the integer value of the string,
not on the number of characters in the string or on the number of strings.

The precise thing to say about the complexity of `print_squared`, then, is that
it is (asymptotically) the square of the number represented by the input string:
so 'n' represents that number.

### How can I know the complexity of my favorite language's library functions?

You can often find out a library function's complexity by reading its
documentation, because the documentation specifies the data structures
associated with that function, and those are typically well understood. If the
function is an operation on a well-understood data structure, and you know the
complexity of that particular operation, you thereby know the function's
complexity.

For example, according to Go's documentation, `containers/list` struct instances
are implemented as doubly-linked lists. This implies that insertion and
retrieval from the front of a list are both O(1) operations, and that finding an
element of a list is an O(n) operation, where 'n' stands for the number of
elements in the list. (In a `containers\list` struct in Go, these are the
`PushFront` and `Front` functions respectively.)

On the other hand, a library's documentation may say little or nothing about a
particular function's complexity. In that case, you may have no recourse other
than reading the library's source code for that function.
