always disturbs me, and I hear this a lot. Here's why you shouldn't do it."

I go to a lot of meetups with junior software developers and students, because
I want to learn how to work better with them, and because I like helping.
One of the most common things I hear from them is a self-deprecating statement
of the form: "I suck at _X_".

Common values for _X_:
- mathematics
- algorithms
- _\<random Javascript framework\>_
- "APIs" (whatever that means)

The people who say this are signaling that they are aware of their flaws and/or
limits, that they're not full of themselves, and that they're both honest and
straightforward. And these are excellent traits to have! But it also often
signals another, very troubling thing: *insecurity*. And insecurity is possibly
the deadliest trait to have as a software developer.

Let me explain.

The thing about the technology industry is that it changes _rapidly_. Consider
that mobile development has existed in its present form only since 2007 (the
year the iPhone launched). Amazon Web Services has gone from a relatively niche,
mostly-internal hosting service to being the infrastructure of the modern
internet in less than ten years. Java's been around since only 1996, and is
already considered a dinosaur by many.

What this means is that, as a software developer, your most valuable skill is
not your knowledge of this or that language or framework or platform: it's your
_ability to learn new things_. And your ability to learn new things depends,
critically, on your confidence that you _can_ learn new things.

Telling me you suck at math, or algorithms, or learning new languages, is just a
veiled way of telling me you don't think you have the one essential trait of
successful software developers. You think you're just being open and
self-deprecating; in reality you're disqualifying yourself.

Of course, you might be saying this in part because you've heard or read
engineers you admire saying _exactly those words_, so you think their saying it
is a way of giving you permission to say it, too. The problem, of course, is
that context matters here.

When Steve Yegge or Jesse Frazelle or Coda Hale or Alice Goldfuss or some other
justly internet-famous engineer says or writes some self-deprecating thing she
might actually believe, keep in mind that she probably has very, very, _VERY_
high standards for competence.  (That's something you'll learn,
hopefully--having high standards for competence is a great trait to have.) Also,
her success means she hasn't allowed whatever it is she is bad at to derail her.
Her confession signals not _insecurity_, but the opposite: the confidence in her
own abilities and accomplishments to be able to admit her flaws.

Also, consider this bit of wisdom from [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com):

These self-deprecating confessions of sucking at things, I submit, can generally
be boiled down to an admission of vulnerability. They all say: I'm scared.

And you're _right_ to be scared! Learning new things can often be terrifying,
for lots of reasons:
- exercising new "muscles"
  - you're studying math seriously for the first time
  - you've never read technical documents
- challenging your self image
  - "I'm not a technical person"
  - being good at software means you're not a screwup
  - doing something solely for yourself means you're selfish
- Fear of failing
  - if you don't learn _X_, you're stupid
  - if you don't learn _X_, you're a failure

This is _therapy-deep_ stuff, and of course reading some guy's blog post isn't
going to magically resolve issues you've lived with your whole adult life. But
Kleon's advice for dealing with them is pretty good: remember that life
is short, and _just keep working_.

To be clear, I'm _NOT_ saying you shouldn't be insecure. We're all insecure
about all sorts of stuff, and it's not something we can simply choose not to be.
The problem is that if you say you suck at _X_, you're doing two things at once:
confessing an insecurity, and _saying you suck at X_. It's totally fine to be
insecure--we all are who we are--but it's not fine to treat your self-professed
flaws as enduring facts about yourself. Instead, put your insecurities to work
for you:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Treat your insecurity as a super power. <br><br>It’s what drives you to verify facts, enable you to play your own devil’s advocate, keeps you open to opinions and ideas different than your own.<br><br>It helps you gain trust, it makes you humble and keeps you human.</p>&mdash; Karen Cohen (@karen_meep) <a href="https://twitter.com/karen_meep/status/1111123109510344706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 



I promise: you won't suck at things you work hard at. Keep working, treat your
insecurities (and [your
failures](https://www.makers.com/blog/abby-wambach-make-failure-your-fuel-barnard-commencement-speech)!)
as fuel to propel you forward, and you'll probably accomplish wonderful things.
