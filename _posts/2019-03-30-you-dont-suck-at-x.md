description: "Hearing a student of software development tell me they suck at something
_always_ upsets me, and I hear this _a lot_. Here's why you shouldn't do it."

I go to a lot of meetups with junior software developers and students, because
I want to learn how to work better with them, and because I like helping.
One of the most common things I hear from them is a self-deprecating statement
of the form:
>I suck at _X_.

Common values for _X_:
- mathematics
- algorithms
- _<random Javascript framework>_
- "APIs" (whatever that means)

The people who say this are signaling that they are aware of their flaws and/or
limits, that they're not full of themselves, and that they're both honest and
straightforward. And these are excellent traits to have! But it also signals
another very, troubling thing: *insecurity*. And insecurity is possibly the
deadliest trait to have as a software developer.

Let me explain.

The thing about the technology industry is that it changes _rapidly_. Consider
that mobile development has existed in its present form only since 2007 (the
year the iPhone launched). Amazon Web Services has gone from a relatively niche,
mostly-internal hosting service to being the infrastructure of the modern
internet in less than ten years. Java's been around since only 1996, and is
already considered a dinosaur by many.

What this means is that, as a software developer, your most valuable skill is
not your knowledge of this or that language or framework or platform: it's your
_ability to learn new things_. And your ability to learn new things depends,
critically, on your confidence that you _can_ learn new things.

Telling me you suck at math, or algorithms, or learning new languages, is just a
veiled way of telling me you don't think you have the one essential trait of
successful software developers. You think you're just being open and
self-deprecating; in reality you're disqualifying yourself.

Also, consider this bit of wisdom from [Austin Kleon](austinkleon.com):

These self-deprecating confessions of sucking at things, I submit, can be boiled
down to an admission of vulnerability. They all say: I'm scared.

And you're _right_ to be scared! Learning new things can often be terrifying,
for lots of reasons:
- exercising new "muscles"
  - you're studying math seriously for the first time
  - you've never read technical documents
- challenging your self image
  - "I'm not a technical person"
  - being good at software means you're not a screwup
  - doing something solely for yourself means you're selfish
- Fear of failing
  - if you don't learn _X_, you're stupid
  - if you don't learn _X_, you're a failure

This is _therapy-deep_ stuff, and of course reading some guy's blog post isn't
going to magically resolve issues you've lived with your whole adult life. But
Kleon's advice for dealing with them is pretty good: remember that life
is short, and _just keep working_.

I promise: you won't suck at things you work hard at. Keep working, don't let
the devil in your ear derail you, and you'll probably accomplish wonderful
things.
