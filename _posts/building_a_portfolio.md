I've talked with a lot of budding engineers, and perhaps the most-asked question
I get from them is this:

>How do I get an interview?

Sadly, this is absolutely the WRONG question for them to be asking me. First, I
don't know the answer; second, because it's focusing on the wrong thing. If they
really want to get jobs as software engineers, they should be asking instead:

>How do I become a good engineer?

Why is that a better question to ask? Simply, because good engineers get
interviews and job offers. (Bad engineers sometimes get interviews and job
offers as well, to be sure; but the success of fools in business is a mystery
best left undwelled upon.)

Of course, it's not enough to be a good engineer; you have to be _visibly_ a good
engineer, someone who is both good and _visible_. Being visible means having
something to show off how good you are.

If you're an experienced engineer, you have a track record. If you've built an
application that's run reliably on web servers for five years and made your
company $10 million per year in revenue and has a million users, well, that's
the sort of thing that speaks for itself. You also probably know a bunch of
people who can vouch for your abilities, many of whom know people in a position
to hire you.

That's basically how people in the software industry get good jobs:
they do good work, gain a reputation for it, and that reputation gets carried
around by word of mouth, eventually reaching the ears of people willing to pay
good money for those engineers to do interesting work.

Inexperienced engineers, on the other hand, have literally done _nothing_ to
deserve a recommendation for a job. This isn't a flaw: everyone starts out that
way. But those engineers don't have a reputation for others to hear about or a
body of work to point to; how do they get themselves noticed?

As a budding engineer, you get noticed for your work in two stages. In the first stage, you
do _excellent_ work; in the second, you _show off_ that work. That is, you
produce a kick-ass portfolio, then promote it unashamedly and relentlessly.
