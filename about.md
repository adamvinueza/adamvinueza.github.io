Hello! I am Adam Vinueza. I live in Louisville, Colorado (a suburb just outside
Boulder), and work as a software engineer. In another life, long ago, I was an
academic philosopher. It wasn't a great life, but I met my wife in graduate
school, and we have a great life with two awesome children, so I can't really
complain.

This blog is mostly about software engineering topics, although they'll tend to
approach those topics from a more human-focused perspective. I like to think
about engineering as a fundamentally human endeavor; I've found that approaching
it that way teaches me a lot.
